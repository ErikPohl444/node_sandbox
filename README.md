# Node Sandbox

This project is designed as a set of large-volume data streaming endpoints built with Node.js. The goal is to provide robust, scalable streaming solutions for handling, processing, and transmitting big data efficiently.

## Features

- High-throughput data streaming endpoints
- Scalable architecture suitable for large data volumes
- Built with Node.js for performance and flexibility
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Data storage or mock data
- `tests/` - Automated tests
- `src/` - Source code (including core streaming logic)
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `.gitignore` - Starter
- Additional files: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md, AUTHORS.md, CODEOWNERS, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, README.md
